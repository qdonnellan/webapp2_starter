# Webapp2 Starter Kit
*Goal: get a working python app up on GAE in less than 1 minute*

The point of this project is to provide a starter kit for developers looking to deploy to Google App Engine in very little time. All you need to do to have your own webapp up and running is to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Change the application name in app.yaml
3. Deploy to Google App Engine

That's it!

## Templates
Templates for this app can be found in the templates file under views

    views
      /templates
         ...

This webapp uses Jinja2 for a lightweight templating experience.
