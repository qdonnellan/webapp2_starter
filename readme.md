# Webapp2 Starter Kit

The point of this project is to provide a starter kit for developers looking to deploy to Google App Engine in very little time. All you need to do to have your own webapp up and running is to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Change the app name in app.yaml from `application: webapp2starter` to `application: whateveryouwant`
3. Deploy to Google App Engine

That's it!
